// Exercises: Arrays

// EXERCISE: Your top choices

// Create an array to hold your top choices (colors, presidents, whatever).
// For each choice, log to the screen a string like: "My #1 choice is blue."
// Bonus: Change it to log "My 1st choice, "My 2nd choice", "My 3rd choice", picking the right suffix for the number based on what it is.

var places = ["Neverland", "NeverNeverLand", "CandyLand", "ColorPlaces"];
console.log("My #1 choice is " + places[0] + ". My 2nd choice is " + places[1] + ". My 3rd choice is " + places[2] + ".");
